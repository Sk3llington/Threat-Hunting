## Network Security


### Snort Rule Analysis

In this section, I analyzed Snort rule logs including malicious scans of a network, phishing attack logs and download of malicious payloads.

Access the analysis here:

### Firewall Basic Security Configuration

In this I go over a basic configuration of 2 free open-source firewalls, `firewalld` and `ufw`.

Access the configuration here:

### Hunting the Nemucod Trojan

In this section, I used logs generated by Snort to track the Nemucod trojan, analyze the IOCs and write a report with mitigation recommendations.
