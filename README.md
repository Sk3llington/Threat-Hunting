## Network Security


### Snort Rule Analysis

In this section, I analyzed `Snort` rule logs including malicious scans of a network, phishing attack logs and download of malicious payloads.

You can access the analysis here:

### Firewall Basic Security Configuration

In this section I go over a basic configuration of a free open-source firewall, `firewalld`.

You can access the configuration demonstration here:

### Hunting the Nemucod Trojan

In this section, I used logs generated by `Snort` to track the Nemucod trojan, analyze the IOCs and write a report with mitigation recommendations.
