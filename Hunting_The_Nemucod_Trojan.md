## The Nemucod Hunt

In this demonstration I will assume the role of a Jr. Security administrator working for the Department of Technology for the State of California.

As a Junior Security Administrator, my primary role is to perform the initial triage of alert data: the initial investigation and analysis followed by an escalation of high priority alerts to senior incident handlers for further review.
 
I will work as part of a Computer and Incident Response Team (CIRT), responsible for compiling **Threat Intelligence** as part of my incident report.
